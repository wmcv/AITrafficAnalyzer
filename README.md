# AITrafficAnalyzer

Highway traffic monitoring using a YOLOv8 model to detect and track vehicles in both northbound and southbound directions. The system calculates vehicle speed, highlights speeding cars, and displays average speed per direction. It also implements algorithms to assess accident risk based on lane density, inter-vehicle distance, and stopping feasibility. Includes a real-time visualization of the non-affine transformation used for speed calculations, displaying a birdâ€™s-eye view of the road with synchronized vehicle movement ðŸš—ðŸ“Š
